Utility library for elementary functions and fast trips in Java.

As a programmer I do not believe that there is a better programming language and a worse programming language, everyone does what he is told to do. The only limit to our software is our imagination and our ability to develop good solutions.

Working with many programming languages, according to the requests and needs of the projects, I have often noticed that many features or many methods, which are present in a particular language, are not present in others. Features or methods that often simplify development or that avoid us from writing boring algorithms that must be replicated in many different projects, on which we happen to work.

I thought, therefore, to develop a library in Java, for those who use this programming language, which contains the best of these algorithms which often and willingly are simple methods that make us waste time or concentration. There are many projects like this but they are always aimed at another purpose. This project aims to create an easy to access and user friendly project.

If you want specific functions to be integrated, write to mattia_zuliani@maianet.it or offer me your algorithms, I will gladly integrate them. Or, if you want, you can contribute to the development of this library yourself.

Bye!
